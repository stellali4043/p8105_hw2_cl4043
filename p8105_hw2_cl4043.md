This is my solution for hw2.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

## Problem 1

``` r
# First, define a path to the dataset. 
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

``` r
# Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

``` r
# Read precipitation data! For 2018 and 2017. 
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

``` r
# define a path to the dataset. 
path_to_data2 = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
```

``` r
# read the nyc transit data
# retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance
nyc_transit =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
           ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:route11, entrance_type, entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.factor) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, `YES` = TRUE, `NO` = FALSE)) # converting entry variable to a logical variable
```

``` r
# tidying nyc_transit data to a long table by route number
nyc_transit_tidy = 
  pivot_longer(
    nyc_transit, 
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number", 
    values_to = "route")

# dropping the NA value when route value contains NA of each route number
nyc_transit_tidy <- nyc_transit_tidy %>% 
  drop_na()
```

This dataset contains information about the train transit system in NYC.
The dataset contains variables such as, line, station\_name,
station\_latitude, station\_longitude, entrance\_type, entry, vending,
ada, route\_number, route. I first used the cleaned the names of each
variable, and then I used the select function to only retain the
variables of interest. I noticed there were both characters and numerics
in the values of route number, so I turned them all into factor. I
realized the route numbers columns were spread across the original
dataset, so I used pivot\_longer to make it into a long table, and then
dropped the rows where the route value is NA. The dimension of the
resulting dataset is 4270, 10, which means there are in total 4270 rows
of observations, and 10 columns.

  - There are 465 distinct stations.

  - Among the distinct stations, there are 103 stations that are ADA
    compliant.

  - There are 273 distinct stations that serve the A station, and among
    these stations, 107 stations are ADA compliant.

  - The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.1046838.

## Problem 3

``` r
# define paths to the datasets. 
path_to_data3 = "./data/pols-month.csv"
path_to_data4 = "./data/snp.csv"
path_to_data5 = "./unemployment.csv"
```

``` r
# read the pols-month.csv
# separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day
pols_month_df =
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv"
           ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(month), as.factor)

# replace month number with month name
pols_month_df$month <- month.abb[pols_month_df$month]

# create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.
pols_month_df <- pols_month_df %>%
  mutate(president = case_when(
    prez_gop == 1 ~ 'gop',
    prez_dem == 1 ~ 'dem'
)) 
pols_month_df <- pols_month_df[-c(3,4,8)]
```

``` r
# separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day
# arrange according to year and month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns
snp_df =
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv"
           ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, c("day", "month", "year")) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  relocate(year, month) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(month), as.factor)

snp_df$month <- month.abb[snp_df$month]
```

``` r
unemployment_df =
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv"
           ) 
  

unemployment_long = 
  pivot_longer(
    unemployment_df, 
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment_rate")

merge_df = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df, by = "month")

merge_final = 
  left_join(merge_df, unemployment_long, by ="month")
```

The dimension of the resulting dataset is 3729732, 14, and contains
variables such as “month”, “unemployment\_rate”, and “president”. The
range of the years is 1948, 2015.
